        <h3>Vision</h3>
        <p>
          Our vision is to supply all students with quality support for their
          education.
        </p>
        <h3>Idea</h3>
        <p>
          Tutoring and mentoring will improve both the academic rigour and
          emotional wellbeing of a student. However, implementing such a system
          in a large school is not an easy feat. Academe erases the arduous
          nature of emailing back-and-forth, scheduling and finding a suitable
          tutor by creating a intuitive platform that encourages peer-to-peer
          support in your local region / school, while at the same time ensuring
          quality of service. Students will be able to aptly address their
          areas-of-improvement with friends they're familiar with, hassle-free.
        </p>
        <p>
          Academe itself was founded by a group of passionate high school
          students who wanted to help others. We understand what it means to be
          a student, so we hope you'll trust us to find you your best support
          tutor/mentor.

      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>
        Academe is committed to protecting the privacy and accuracy of your
        confidential information to the extent possible, subject to the
        provisions of New Zealand law. Other than as required by laws that
        guarantee public access to certain types of information, or in response
        to subpoenas or other legal instruments that authorize access,
        personally identifiable information is not shared without your
        permission.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <h2>Information collected&nbsp;</h2>
      <p>
        Academe&rsquo;s website may collect personal information such as names,
        addresses, email addresses, telephone numbers, bank details, and/or
        tutoring interests. Furnishing the specifically designated information
        requested on our tutoring/tutee forms, including name, full address,
        email address, and credit card payment information is necessary for
        online purchases and to process all tax-deductible donations. Full names
        and addresses are also collected for purposes of fulfilling brochure
        requests via the online form.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition, email addresses and tutoring/tutee interests are necessary
        to process all tutoring/tutee requests. Because our database is large
        and we have numerous name duplications (i.e. John Williams), we collect
        mailing addresses as well to enable us to match the correct email
        address and requested information with the correct name file (John
        Williams) in our database. Anyone can choose to be removed from our
        tutoring/tutee list at any time.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        Academe servers typically collect, at least temporarily, the following
        information: Internet Protocol (IP) address of computer being used; web
        pages requested; referring web page; browser used; date and time.
        Academe may collect statistics identifying particular IP addresses from
        which our websites are accessed.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <h2>Use of collected information&nbsp;</h2>
      <p>
        Academe may use personal information such as name as mailing address
        collected from websites for the purpose of future communication back to
        online enrollees, in order to keep you informed of additional Academe
        activities or other related types of events, but only if you are
        provided the opportunity to opt out of that type of use.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        Your bank details will be kept secure and only used for appropriately
        charging for online purchases. Cancellations of financial subscriptions
        should be made three days prior to the renewal of the subscription. Once
        a cancellation is made, Academe will not retain your bank details unless
        you specifically request this.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        Academe may use personal information such as email address for the
        purpose of future communication back to online enrollees regarding a
        current or prior online purchase of tutoring. With the exception of the
        initial confirmation email regarding an online purchase, you are given
        the opportunity to opt-out of any further business email communications
        from Academe.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        Academe only sends mail listing marketing communications and offers only
        to those who specifically opt-in to the service and submit their emails
        to us for that purpose. Anyone can choose to be removed from our Email
        Club mailing list at any time. We will not sell, trade or share email
        addresses to/with companies or other organizations without your
        expressed permission.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        Academe may use browser-IP-address information and anonymous-browser
        history to report information about site accesses and for profiling
        purposes. This information is generally used to improve Web presentation
        and utilization. The campus also may use IP address information for
        troubleshooting purposes.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        Academe sites may use "cookies" in order to deliver web content specific
        to individual users' interests or to keep track of online purchasing
